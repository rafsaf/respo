# Declaring roles and permissions

## Creating yml file

Respo provides complete and easy way of declaring roles and permissions.

The whole idea is to have all of them in single `yml` file that will be source of truth for the app. (later, we will convert it to pickle format after validation).

For this tutorial, we will work on file `respo_model.yml` that will be used in next sections.

## Content of respo_model.yml

```yml
{!./examples/user_guide/index/general.yml!}
```

## Permissions
