# Get respo model

## Load generated model in Python code

In previous section, we created `.respo_cache` folder and `respo_model.py` file for better autocompletion.

To load your respo model in the app and pass it around, you can now use following code, typically you should put it in file like `main.py`, `settings.py`, `config.py` or similar:

```python
{!./examples/usage/main_roles.py!}

```

We will be using it in next sections.
